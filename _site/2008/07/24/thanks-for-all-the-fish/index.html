<p>I greatly appreciate everyone's comments and input on my article on <a href="http://phy5ics.com/blog/2008/03/16/bluetooth-gps-actionscript-part-1-hardware/">Bluetooth and GPS </a><br />
.&Acirc;&nbsp; It is quite nice to have the exposure from Make and also to have one's efforts peer reviewed as it leads to productive introspection around one's work.</p>

<p>Allow me to respond to those who took the time to comment on my little project:</p>

<p><strong>To Tam, David and Snoopy:</strong><br />
No, I didn't actually short out the entire board by connecting VCC+ and GND.&Acirc;&nbsp; That is a mistake in my first attempt to draw out a schematic in Illustrator.&Acirc;&nbsp; So to those that are copying this project word-for-word - please don't follow the diagram exactly.&Acirc;&nbsp; I'll update it in the next couple of days when I have a chance.&Acirc;&nbsp; As an aside, I'd be curious to hear from others about what they use for drawing circuit diagrams.&Acirc;&nbsp; I just use Illustrator because that's what I know from my days long past as a designer.</p>

<p><strong>To Siftah and Arto:</strong><br />
What I've done is most definitely available as a commercial product and most likely for less than I invested in the various components.&Acirc;&nbsp; However, I just happen to be a nerd and am quite interested in learning from products and devices that may exist for an equal or greater price.</p>

<p>Because I cobbled my project together from off-the-shelf components, I can continually break down and re-combine any of the components I utilized into more-and-more interesting and complicated projects.&Acirc;&nbsp; With a consumer product, I would be beholden to whatever the particular manufacturer of that consumer product dictated the functionality of a given device to be.</p>

<p>Additionally, while I'm not entirely familiar with what is on the market with regards to Bluetooth GPS devices, it's much cooler, in my opinion, to be able to do whatever I want with the IMEA codes that I ingest and store from a piece of hardware via my own drivers and software as compared with what a GPS hardware/software vendor happens to expose via a crippled API in response to what their marketing team thinks that I might be interested in doing with said data that I collected via blood, sweat and tears on the trail.&Acirc;&nbsp; Isn't that why we all read and love Make?</p>

<p><p>Birds have dominated the sky since the day that they evolved to become flying creatures.&Acirc;&nbsp; However, since man has gazed upon them, we have looked to them for&Acirc;&nbsp; inspiration and in envy, often (unsuccessfully) invoking their form in an attempt to share the currents and soar above.&Acirc;&nbsp; So, while I could theoretically transmute into a bird (or purchase one) to create an exact replica of something that already exists, by creating a reasonable facsimile I can learn how exactly it works, improve upon it and have fun doing it.</p>&lt;!-- ~ --&gt;&lt;!-- ~ --&gt;</p>
