<p>I am pleased to announce that the Cannes Lions Touchwall 2009 captured the "Best integration with experiential/activity" award given out by MediaPost's Digital Out of Home division.&Acirc;&nbsp; This is a satisfying validation of an experience that takes a technology for which very few practical applications exist (touchwalls) and augmented it with an unobtrusive form of authentication via RFID to provide a compelling, personalized informational and social experience for Cannes Lions Festival delegates.</p>
