I feel like I'm making an introduction at AA or something...

Hi, my name is John Barton and I am addicted to technology.&Acirc;&nbsp; I've squandered the good will of my family and friends and lost countless hours of sleep because I've worked for interactive and advertising agencies in various capacities, as both a designer and developer over the past 10 years.&Acirc;&nbsp; I've sunk to such depths as bartering Flash banner ads for bar tabs to prostrating myself before clients demanding to "make the logo bigger and less to add more zing".&Acirc;&nbsp; At one point I even quit the business and went to work in a small rustic Italian restaurant where I washed dishes and learned how to be a chef and operate in the pressure cooker that is a restaurant kitchen.

However, I've also managed to do great work at great agencies for great clients, and that's what keeps me going these days.&Acirc;&nbsp; I am currently a Senior Solutions Architect at <a href="http://schematic.com" target="_blank">Schematic</a>.&Acirc;&nbsp; I work out the New York office where I lead large cross-disciplinary technology teams on new technology projects for clients such as ABC, Microsoft, Sandisk, Scholastic and Sun Microsystems, among others.
