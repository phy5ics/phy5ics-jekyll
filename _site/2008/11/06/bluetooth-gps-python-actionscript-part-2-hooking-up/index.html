<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>After having built the hardware in Part 1, it is fairly useless without a way to get the GPS data from the device somewhere else in order to do something useful with it.&Acirc;&nbsp; For this project, the end result will be a visualization of the GPS data in Flash Player on a Mac.&Acirc;&nbsp; There are myriad ways to accomplish this, however very few approaches can easily encapsulate all of these steps in a single language.&Acirc;&nbsp; This is because both low-level system access (to read the serial data) and some sort of server (to serve the data to Flash Player) are required.&Acirc;&nbsp; While it is definitely possible to use any number of other languages such as Java, Processing, C++, etc., performing all of these tasks with those languages would require significant amounts of code.</p>

<p>With that said, I opted for Python not only because I love it, but also because it is quite straightforward to use it to read from a serial port using the <a href="http://pyserial.wiki.sourceforge.net/pySerial" target="_blank">pyserial module</a> and also to establish any number of different types of servers including standard HTTP and socket servers.&Acirc;&nbsp; While there are built-in libraries for creating and managing servers, I ultimately decided on creating a socket server using <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/" target="_blank">Twisted</a>.&Acirc;&nbsp; Twisted is an enormously powerful networking framework that simplifies the creation of all sorts of servers.</p>

<p>Why add another framework when a standard HTTP server would suffice for serving up data to the Flash Player?&Acirc;&nbsp; The implementation of a standard HTTP server would require Flash Player polling the service to determine if data had been updated.&Acirc;&nbsp; So, rather than rely on that sub-par solution, Twisted makes the creation of socket servers very easy, which then allows the Flash Player to receive data in real-time via an XMLSocket connection.&Acirc;&nbsp; Not only that, but one of the coolest aspects of Twisted is that it makes it fairly easy to write multi-user socket servers, which will be a nice addition for future enhancements</p>

<p>Here is what the overall system architecture ends up looking like when all of that is considered:</p>

<p><a href="http://phy5ics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/gps_bt_sys_arch.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-62" title="gps_bt_sys_arch" src="http://phy5ics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/gps_bt_sys_arch.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>However, before diving into these details, the first step is to hook up the device to the Mac via a serial Bluetooth connection and verifying that everything is working so far.</p>

<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-58"></a></p>

<p><strong>Bluetooth Pairing</strong>
Obviously, the first step is to power up the board.&Acirc;&nbsp; After that, pairing the BlueSMiRF with the Mac.&Acirc;&nbsp; This is a very straightforward process.&Acirc;&nbsp; From the Bluetooth preference pane in System Preferences, click the &quot;+&quot; icon to add a new Bluetooth device.&Acirc;&nbsp; Advance through the dialog boxes, configuring the device that shows up as <strong><em>SparkFun-BT</em></strong>.&Acirc;&nbsp; The passkey for BlueSMiRF module is <strong><em>default</em></strong>, so type that in when prompted.</p>

<p><a href="http://phy5ics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/bt_pairing.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-59" title="bt_pairing" src="http://phy5ics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/bt_pairing.jpg" /></a>
Once that&#39;s been done, by checking the serial interfaces in <strong><em>/dev</em></strong>, it can be verified that it is now active as a serial device.&Acirc;&nbsp; That is done by opening a terminal window and typing <strong><em>ls /dev/tty.*</em></strong>.&Acirc;&nbsp; That will list out all available serial interfaces.&Acirc;&nbsp; The BlueSMiRF should show up as something like <strong><em>tty.SparkFun-BT-COM0-1</em></strong>.</p>

<p><a href="http://phy5ics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/ls_tty.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-60" title="ls_tty" src="http://phy5ics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/ls_tty.jpg" /></a></p>

<p><strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>Screen</strong>
Screen is a Unix application that allows one to attach a terminal session to a particular process.&Acirc;&nbsp; To view the serial communication that is happening on the serial port that the BlueSMiRF is attached to, this is a good option.&Acirc;&nbsp; This can be done by typing the following command into the terminal to view the serial communication on that port in realtime:</p>

<p><strong><em>screen /dev/tty.SparkFun-BT-COM0-1 9600</em></strong></p>

<p>Note that the <strong><em>9600</em></strong> at the end of that command is the baud rate.&Acirc;&nbsp; That command should yield some cryptic messages being printed in Terminal like the following if everything else is wired up properly:</p>

<p><a href="http://phy5ics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/nmea.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-61" title="nmea" src="http://phy5ics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/nmea.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>To exit screen, hit <strong><em>control-a</em></strong>, then <strong><em>control-&lt;/em&gt;</strong>.</p>

<p>The strings that are seen here are NMEA strings, which are derived from a specification that standardizes the way that marine electronics communicate with each other.&Acirc;&nbsp; For additional information on this, check out <a href="http://www.gpsinformation.org/dale/nmea.htm">http://www.gpsinformation.org/dale/nmea.htm</a>.&Acirc;&nbsp; If the GPS has a location fix, then numerous lines beginning with $GPGGA will be displayed, which precedes messages that contain the location fix data.&Acirc;&nbsp; Otherwise, there will be mostly $GPGSV, which represents data regarding the GPS satellites themselves.</p>

<p><strong>OK, Now What?</strong></p>

<p>Now that there is data coming in over a virtual serial port, the next step is writing the software.&Acirc;&nbsp; The next article in this series will examine the Twisted socket server and Flash XMLSocket connection along with providing the source code for those systems.</p>
