<p>I just attended Adobe&#39;s on AIR Bus Tour the other day on its stop in Los Angeles.  While typically those types of event don&#39;t delve deep enough into details to be of much interest, I figured that I&#39;d attend anyway since I&#39;ve been away from the computer for so long on vacation and needed to catch up on some new stuff.  The vast majority of the talks were JavaScript-centric which was interesting and perhaps highlights Adobe&#39;s desire to sway over the current generation of standards- and open-source centric client-side developers to a proprietary technology, but more on that in another post.</p>

<p>Anyway, I had hopes of converting an app that I had been working on over to an AIR app for desktop deployment.  The app that I was going to port over was a quick and rather silly app that I threw together using the Yahoo! Maps API and an geoRSS feed constructed using Yahoo! Pipes to filter earthquake data from the USGS.  However, I quickly remembered that developing against an alpha release of anything can be tedious at best.</p>

<p>Being as how I had implemented Yahoo! Maps in the app, which is apparently still being fully ported to AS3 and uses a wrapper to interface with the AS2 version of the mapping APIs and actual map SWF, I immediately encountered an error on publish:</p>

<p><code class="prettyprint">Error: Error #2067: The ExternalInterface is not available in this container. ExternalInterface requires Internet Explorer, ActiveX, Firefox, Mozilla 1.7.5 and greater, or other browsers that support NPRuntime</code></p>

<p>So, until I get a chance to code an HTML/JS version of the API using the new HTML component, I&#39;m stuck with FlexQuake, not the intended AIRQuake:</p>

<p>It&#39;s still kinda cool if you live in California and want to see the earthquakes over M 2.5 that have occurred over the last 7 days.</p>
