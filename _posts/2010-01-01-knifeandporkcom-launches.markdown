<p>I am excited to announce that my new project for 2010 and beyond has launched.  While not technology related, it represents the other passions that I hold near-and-dear: cooking and photography.  The new year starts off properly with Black-Eyed Peas with Smoked Ham Hocks served alonside Collard Greens with Bacon and Red Onion.  Be sure to check back often, as I cook nearly every night.</p>
